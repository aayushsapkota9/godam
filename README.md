# Problem
In many warehouses, staff have to manually count how many cartons a delivery person takes out for each order. This manual counting often leads to mistakes ‚Äî for example, someone might take 52 cartons instead of the 50 they were supposed to. These small errors add up over time, causing loss of goods and confusion in inventory.

To solve this problem, we are building a smart system that uses cameras and software to automatically track each person and count exactly how many cartons they carry out. This helps make the process more accurate, faster, and prevents loss.
